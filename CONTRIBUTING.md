## 📌 About the Project

**Screentime-Recoder** is a desktop application built for **desktop** that helps users track how much time they spend on different applications — just like the Screen Time feature on smartphones 📱, but for **MacBooks 💻**. 

The aim is to promote digital wellness, boost productivity, and give users insights into their screen habits.
